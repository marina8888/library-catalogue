# Cataloguing Programme for a Library

![alt-text](Diagram.png?raw=true "Diagram")



1.	Your company has won a contract to create a software system for a local library. The library stocks three types of items: books, films and music albums. The program should allow a librarian to add new items to the cataloguing system, to issue the items to the library members and to update the returned items. Your colleagues have provided you with the following class hierarchy diagram: 

2.	Write a C++ class Entry according to the given diagram. Derive from it three subclasses: MusicAlbum, Book and Film. The class Entry should have member variables to store the name of the item and if it is borrowed and by who. The subclasses should have additional data members as specified in the diagram. Include member function declarations into your four class definitions according to the diagram. In addition, include two constructor declarations for each of the subclasses: one constructor with parameters for passing the values of all data members and another constructor with no parameters, but which allows the user to enter the values for all data members interactively. Use virtual functions appropriately.

3.	Write definitions of all member functions for classes Entry and Film. The functions printDetails() should display the values of their class data members.	  	       							

4.	Expand your classes with useful extra data members and functionality.					
					
5.	Write a C++ program, which will use the above classes. Use as many of the C++ and C++ Standard Library features as you can.
