# Cataloguing Programme for Library

A simple programme for a library. The library stocks three different  types of items: books, films and music albums. The programme allows a librarian to add new items to the cataloguing system, to issue the items to the library members and to update the returned items. There are three types of media: DVD, books, and music album.
Information for different media types can be entered interactively and printed to the user.
